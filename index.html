<h1 style="font-family:castellar;">CHARLIE</h1>
<h2 style="font-family:castellar;">SAVE CHARLIE</h2>
<p style="font-family:courier;">charlie is the knob at my high school and he's annoying.
I mean, super brainiac annoying.  He knows the most random stuff.  Like
if he starts on edward he will lose.the issue is he still does it.
He's always dropping the little facts about everything. He
doesn't realize what a geek he is for doing it, he's just really into being annoying.
I think he really doesn't understand that not everybody is. I don't listen to him at school but I hear he's a pretty annoying guy.
He gets a lot of practice at home, that's for sure.

The whole time I've been in high school I've always had to
hear what other kids thought of him. Some kids dissed him because he was annoying.
Some kids just dissed him period because that's what you do with knob.
PAY $4 to me and i will save him. </p>
